# Rekall discontinuation

This project is no longer maintained.

In December 2011, a new branch within the Volatility project was created to explore how to make the code base more modular, improve performance, and increase usability. This branch was later forked to become Rekall. The modularity allowed physical memory analysis functionality to be used in [GRR](https://github.com/google/grr) to enable remote live in-memory analysis.

## Lessons learned:

* Rekall has introduced many improvements to memory analysis methodology over the years. For more information see: http://blog.rekall-forensic.com/ 
* Rekall framework allowed for limited modularization due to the nature of interdependent in-memory structure and early architectural decisions.
* Increasing RAM sizes and security measures like memory encryption are making traditional physical memory analysis more cumbersome.
* Physical memory analysis is fragile and maintenance heavy. Most physical memory analysis tools are basically kernel debuggers, without access to the source and debug symbols. Most memory analysis therefore can be a costly process of debugging / reverse engineering and keeping debug symbols / structure definitions up to date.

Active development on Rekall has been halted for a while. GRR has switched from using Rekall to [YARA](https://grr-doc.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.0/release-notes.html) supporting a limited set of memory analysis capabilities that requires significantly less maintenance.

Core developers / maintainers for Rekall have other priorities and no one has stepped up to help out with maintenance. Therefore the Rekall project is discontinued. The project will be archived, and you are free to fork it and continue to make [changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

Winpmem will be continued as a separate project currently maintained at https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem. 

# The Rekall Forensic and Incident Response Framework

The Rekall Framework is a completely open collection of tools,
implemented in Python under the Apache and GNU General Public License,
for the extraction and analysis of digital artifacts computer systems.

The Rekall distribution is available from:
<http://www.rekall-forensic.com/>

Rekall should run on any platform that supports
[Python](http://www.python.org)

Rekall supports investigations of the following 32bit and 64bit memory
images:

- Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3
- Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 0 and 1
- Microsoft Windows 8 and 8.1
- Microsoft Windows 10
- Linux Kernels 2.6.24 to most recent.
- OSX 10.7-10.12.x.

Rekall also provides a complete memory sample acquisition capability for all
major operating systems (see the tools directory).

## Quick start

Rekall is available as a python package installable via the pip
package manager. To install it, first create a virtal env, switch to
it and then install rekall:

```
$ virtualenv  /tmp/MyEnv
New python executable in /tmp/MyEnv/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip...done.
$ source /tmp/MyEnv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
$ pip install rekall-agent rekall
```

For windows, Rekall is also available as a self contained installer
package. Please check the download page for the most appropriate installer to
use [Rekall-Forensic.com](http://www.rekall-forensic.com/)

To install from this git repository you will need to use pip
--editable and follow the correct order of installation (otherwise pip
will pull released dependencies which might be older):

```
$ virtualenv  /tmp/MyEnv
New python executable in /tmp/MyEnv/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip...done.
$ source /tmp/MyEnv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
$ git clone https://github.com/google/rekall.git rekall
$ pip install --editable rekall/rekall-lib
$ pip install --editable rekall/rekall-core
$ pip install --editable rekall/rekall-agent
$ pip install --editable rekall
```

On Windows you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C compilers
for python (for more info see this blog post
http://rekall-forensic.blogspot.ch/2015/09/installing-rekall-on-windows.html)

## History

In December 2011, a new branch within the Volatility project was created to
explore how to make the code base more modular, improve performance, and
increase usability. The modularity allowed Volatility to be used in GRR, making
memory analysis a core part of a strategy to enable remote live forensics.  As a
result, both GRR and Volatility would be able to use each other's strengths.

Over time this branch has become known as the "scudette" branch or the
"Technology Preview" branch.  It was always a goal to try to get these changes
into the main Volatility code base.  But, after two years of ongoing
development, the "Technology Preview" was never accepted into the Volatility
trunk version.

Since it seemed unlikely these changes would be incorporated in the future, it
made sense to develop the Technology Preview branch as a separate project. On
December 13, 2013, the former branch was forked to create a new stand-alone
project named "Rekall.‚Äù This new project incorporates changes made to streamline
the codebase so that Rekall can be used as a library. Methods for memory
acquisition and other outside contributions have also been included that were
not in the Volatility codebase.

Rekall strives to advance the state of the art in memory analysis, implementing
the best algorithms currently available and a complete memory acquisition and
analysis solution for at least Windows, OSX and Linux.
